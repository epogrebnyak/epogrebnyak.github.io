## Econometrics and computer skills

- [Econometrics Navigator :material-github:](https://trics.me/) is a guide to free and open econometrics and machine learning textbooks and good tutorials.

  computer and data skills for economists (in Russian).

- My Russian translation of [Functional Programming Jargon :material-github:](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/functional-programming-jargon/).

## Reliability engineering

## Tools I used for my previous pages

This site replaces a few peronal web pages I build earlier using various static site generators:

- [Academic theme for Hugo][academic][^1] (now part of Wowchemy CMS) stands out as a construction kit specifically for scholarly pages, but something as simple as [Google Sites][sites] is less hassle to maintain. [:material-github:](github.com/epogrebnyak/homepage)

[^1]: Hugo is great to use with superb [Doks theme](https://getdoks.org/).

[academic]: https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic
[sites]: https://sites.google.com/new

- [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) is a great to publish notebooks, markdown and reStructuredText (rst) texts in a book view. [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) for R and [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and [Furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/) have similar layouts. [:material-github:](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/learn)

- [icode :material-github:](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/icode/) and [observer :material-github:](https://epogrebnyak.gitlab.io/observer/) (mirror) are built with [loveit](https://hugoloveit.com/) theme. It's a nice blogging theme for Hugo and actively maintained! Inserting Twitter card by shortcode is a killer feature - mkdocs does not seem to have this capability yet.

- [things I learned (TIL)](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/til) was a short experiment in [Zettelkasten][z]-style note-taking, it is plain text files sitting in a repo. Can also use
  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [orgroam](https://www.orgroam.com/), [Notable](https://notable.app/). [:material-github:](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/til)

[z]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten

- two tweet collections with a bit of [Twitter card generation in
  Python](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/topics/blob/main/convert.py)
  [:material-github:](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/topics/)
  [:material-github:](https://epogrebnyak.gitlab.io/retweets)

- my short bio and projects at [README.md](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/epogrebnyak).
