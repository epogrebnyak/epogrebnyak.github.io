## Tools I used for my previous pages

This site replaces a few peronal web pages I build earlier using various static site generators:

- [Academic theme for Hugo][academic][^1] (now part of Wowchemy CMS) stands out as a construction kit specifically for scholarly pages, but something as simple as [Google Sites][sites] is less hassle to maintain. [:material-github:](github.com/epogrebnyak/homepage)

[academic]: https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic  
[^1]: Hugo is great to use with superb [Doks theme](https://getdoks.org/).
[sites]: https://sites.google.com/new

- [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) is a great to publish notebooks, markdown and reStructuredText (rst) texts in a book view. [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) for R and [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and [Furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/) have similar layouts.

- [icode](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/icode/) is built with [loveit](https://hugoloveit.com/) theme. I'm glad it is actively maintained, it's a nice blogging theme for Hugo! Inserting Twitter card by shortcode is a killer feature - mkdocs does not seem to have this capability yet.

- [things I learned (TIL)](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/til) was a short experiment in [Zettelkasten][z]-style note-taking, it is plain text files sitting in a repo. Can also use
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [orgroam](https://www.orgroam.com/), [Notable](https://notable.app/). [:material-github:](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/til)
