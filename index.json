My setup Some steps in my site setup I have spent a bit extra time with:\n contacts section configuration explained in Leslie Myint blog post added StackOverflow fas icon (had to look up a font library, can be provided by default) contact form by https://formspree.io will need activation (both on localhost and your server) added personal photo as avatar.png (from the layout code it appears that file extension does not matter) replaced favicon as suggested in docs  I disabled the following sections:\n people and groups - probably good for another, more collaborative site publications, featured (duplicated, not filled yet) skills (great look, had it in Jekyll CV, but how do you access + must move off the front page) accomplishments (must put a list of econometrics courses in) talks (would be nice to recollect!) experience (to fill later, was not filled in a CV) hero widget  Also moved several files (including .sh) to ignore folder - cleans root of the repository.\nIs blog a relic? I first disabled the blog too. I thought of blogging as such an archaic activity, but now I see it as a form of notetaking and knowledge management. And the best way of managing some internal knowledge is:\nThe most effective way to share knowledge within your organization is to share it with the whole world\n\u0026mdash; Chris Whong (@chris_whong) March 14, 2019 \nWhy filtering? Also is Academic documentation web site blocking traffic from Russia? A provider thing or site configuration? Had to use a proxy to access it, but the proxy also interferes with localhost - rather messy.\nUPDATE: blocking no more as of 16-03-2019. Maybe a coffee helped.\nGratitude I paid up for a coffee to Academic on paypal.
